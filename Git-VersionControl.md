# What is Version Control?
Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions 
later. 

Version Control System allows us to:
- revert selected files back to a previous state
- revert the entire project back to a previous state
- compare changes over time
- see who last modified something
- who & when introduced an issue 

So, to do this kind of stuff there is need of some kind of tool this is where git comes into play. 


# What is Git & How it differs from other VCSs?
Git is Version Control System/Tool like others but its kind of different when it comes to storing of changes made to files. 
Git works on the logic of referencing. When we save or commit the project at some point, git references to change that 
has been made to the file & for other files which are not changed it just stored the previous reference into current snapshot.
Likewise, it creates version of the project by giving references to each change that has been committed or saved.
